[[br.overview]]
== Overview

Backup-and-restore is a standard set of operations for many databases. An effective backup-and-restore
strategy helps ensure that you can recover data in case of data loss or failures. The HBase backup-and-restore
utility helps ensure that enterprises using HBase as a data repository can recover from these types of
incidents. Another important feature of the backup-and-restore utility is the ability to restore the
database to a particular point-in-time, commonly referred to as a snapshot.

The HBase backup-and-restore utility features both full backups and incremental backups. A full backup
is required at least once. The full backup is the foundation on which incremental backups are applied
to build iterative snapshots. Incremental backups can be run on a schedule to capture changes over time,
for example by using a Cron job. Incremental backup is more cost effective because it only captures the
changes. It also enables you to restore the database to any incremental backup version. Furthermore, the
utilities also enable table-level data backup-and-recovery if you do not want to restore the entire dataset
of the backup.

[[br.planning]]
== Planning

There are a few strategies you can use to implement backup-and-restore in your environment. The following sections
show how they are implemented and identify potential tradeoffs.

WARNING: This backup and restore tools has not been tested on Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) enabled HDFS clusters.
This is related to the open issue link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16178[HBASE-16178].

[[br.intracluster.backup]]
=== Backup within a cluster

Backup-and-restore within the same cluster is only appropriate for testing. This strategy is not suitable for production
unless the underlying HDFS layer is backed up and is reliably recoverable.

.Intra-Cluster Backup
image::backup-intra-cluster.png[]

[[br.dedicated.cluster.backup]]
=== Backup using a dedicated cluster

This strategy provides greater fault tolerance and provides a path towards disaster recovery. In this setting, you will
store the backup on a separate HDFS cluster by supplying the backup destination cluster’s HDFS URL to the backup utility.
You should consider backing up to a different physical location, such as a different data center.

Typically, a backup-dedicated HDFS cluster uses a more economical hardware profile.

.Dedicated HDFS Cluster Backup
image::backup-dedicated-cluster.png[]

[[br.cloud.or.vendor.backup]]
=== Backup to the Cloud or a storage vendor appliance

Another approach to safeguarding HBase incremental backups is to store the data on provisioned, secure servers that belong
to third-party vendors and that are located off-site. The vendor can be a public cloud provider or a storage vendor who uses
a Hadoop-compatible file system, such as S3 and other HDFS-compatible destinations.

.Backup to Cloud or Vendor Storage Solutions
image::backup-cloud-appliance.png[]

NOTE: The HBase backup utility does not support backup to multiple destinations. A workaround is to manually create copies
of the backup files from HDFS or S3.

[[br.best.practices]]
## Best Practices

_Formulate a restore strategy and test it._

Before you rely on a backup-and-restore strategy for your production environment, identify how backups must be performed,
and more importantly, how restores must be performed. Test the plan to ensure that it is workable.
At a minimum, store backup data from a production cluster on a different cluster or server. To further safeguard the data,
use a backup location that is at a different site.

If you have a unrecoverable loss of data on your primary production cluster as a result of computer system issues, you may
be able to restore the data from a different cluster or server at the same site. However, a disaster that destroys the whole
site renders locally stored backups useless. Consider storing the backup data and necessary resources (both computing capacity
and operator expertise) to restore the data at a site sufficiently remote from the production site. In the case of a catastrophe
at the whole primary site (fire, earthquake, etc.), the remote backup site can be very valuable.

_Secure a full backup image first._

As a baseline, you must complete a full backup of HBase data at least once before you can rely on incremental backups. The full
backup should be stored outside of the source cluster. To ensure complete dataset recovery, you must run the restore utility
with the option to restore baseline full backup. The full backup is the foundation of your dataset. Incremental backup data
is applied on top of the full backup during the restore operation to return you to the point in time when backup was last taken.

_Define and use backup sets for groups of tables that are logical subsets of the entire dataset._

You can group tables into an object called a backup set. A backup set can save time when you have a particular group of tables
that you expect to repeatedly back up or restore.

When you create a backup set, you type table names to include in the group. The backup set includes not only groups of related
tables, but also retains the HBase backup metadata. Afterwards, you can invoke the backup set name to indicate what tables apply
to the command execution instead of entering all the table names individually.

_Document the backup-and-restore strategy, and ideally log information about each backup._

Document the whole process so that the knowledge base can transfer to new administrators after employee turnover. As an extra
safety precaution, also log the calendar date, time, and other relevant details about the data of each backup. This metadata
can potentially help locate a particular dataset in case of source cluster failure or primary site disaster. Maintain duplicate
copies of all documentation: one copy at the production cluster site and another at the backup location or wherever it can be
accessed by an administrator remotely from the production cluster.

[[br.running.utility]]
## Running the Backup and Restore Utility

This section details the commands and their arguments of the backup-and-restore utility, as well as example usage based on task.

WARNING: The YARN *container-executor.cfg* configuration file must have the following property setting: _allowed.system.users=hbase_. No spaces
are allowed in entries of this configuration file.

*Example of a valid container-executor.cfg file for backup and restore:*

[source]
----
yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs=/var/log/hadoop/mapred
yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.group=yarn
banned.users=hdfs,yarn,mapred,bin
allowed.system.users=hbase
min.user.id=500
----

NOTE: Run the command `hbase backup help <command>` to access the online help that provides basic information about a command
and its options.

[[br.creating.complete.backup]]
## Creating and Maintaining a Complete Backup Image

[NOTE]
====
For HBase clusters also using Apache Phoenix: include the SQL system catalog tables in the backup. In the event that you
need to restore the HBase backup, access to the system catalog tables enable you to resume Phoenix interoperability with the
restored data.
====

The first step in running the backup-and-restore utilities is to perform a full backup and to store the data in a separate image
from the source. At a minimum, you must do this to get a baseline before you can rely on incremental backups.

Run the following command as HBase superuser:

[source]
----
hbase backup create
	{{ full | incremental }
	 {backup_root_path}
	 {[tables] | [-set backup_set_name]}}

	[[-silent] |
	 [-w number_of_workers] |
	 [-b bandwidth_per_worker]]
----

After the command finishes running, the console prints a SUCCESS or FAILURE status message. The SUCCESS message includes a _backup_ ID.
The backup ID is the Unix time (also known as Epoch time) that the HBase master received the backup request from the client.

[TIP]
====
Record the backup ID that appears at the end of a successful backup. In case the source cluster fails and you need to recover the
dataset with a restore operation, having the backup ID readily available can save time.
====

[[br.create.required.cli.arguments]]
### Required Command-Line Arguments

_full_ or _incremental_::
  Using the _full_ argument creates a full backup image. The _incremental_ argument directs the command to create an incremental backup
  that has an image of data changes since the immediately preceding backup, either the full backup or the previous incremental backup.

_backup_root_path_::
  The _backup_root_path_ argument specifies the full filesystem URI of where to store the backup image. Valid prefixes are
  are _hdfs:_, _webhdfs:_, _gpfs:_, and _s3fs:_.

[[br.create.optional.cli.arguments]]
### Optional Command-Line Arguments

_tables_::
  Table or tables to back up. If no table is specified, all tables are backed up. The values for this argument must be entered directly
  after the _backup_root_path_ argument. Specify tables in a comma-separated list. Namespace wildcards are not supported yet, so to backup
  a namespace you must enter a full list of tables in the namespace.

_-set <backup_set_name>_::
  The _-set_ option invokes an existing backup set in the command. See <<br.using.backup.sets,Using Backup Sets>> for the purpose and usage
  of backup sets.

_-silent_::
  Directs the command to not display progress and completes execution without manual interaction.

_-w <number>-::
  Specifies the number of parallel workers to copy data to backup destination (for example, number of map tasks in a MapReduce job).

_-b <bandwidth_per_worker>_::
  Specifies the bandwidth of each worker in MB per second.

[[br.usage.examples]]
### Example usage

[source]
----
$ hbase backup create full hdfs://host5:8020/data/backup SALES2,SALES3 -w 3
----

This command creates a full backup image of two tables, SALES2 and SALES3, in the HDFS instance who NameNode is host5:8020
in the path _/data/backup_. THe _-w_ option specifies that no more than three parallel works complete the operation.


[[br.managing.backup.progress]]
## Managing Backup Progress

You can monitor a running backup by running the _hbase backup progress_ command and specifying the backup ID as an argument.

For example, run the following command as hbase superuser to view the progress of a backup

[source]
----
$ hbase backup progress {backupId}
----

[[br.progress.required.cli.arguments]]
### Required Command-Line Arguments

_backupId_::
  Specifies the backup that you want to monitor by seeing the progress information. The backupId is case-sensitive.

[[br.progress.example]]
### Example usage

[source]
----
hbase backup progress backupId_1467823988425
----

[[br.using.backup.sets]]
## Using Backup Sets

Backup sets can ease the administration of HBase data backups and restores by reducing the amount of repetitive input
of table names. You can group tables into a named backup set with the `hbase backup set add` command. You can then use
the -set option to invoke the name of a backup set in the `hbase backup create` or `hbase backup restore` rather than list
individually every table in the group. You can have multiple backup sets.

NOTE: Note the differentiation between the `hbase backup set add` command and the _-set_ option. The `hbase backup set add`
command must be run before using the `-set` option in a different command because backup sets must be named and defined
before using backup sets as a shortcut.

If you run the `hbase backup set add` command and specify a backup set name that does not yet exist on your system, a new set
is created. If you run the command with the name of an existing backup set name, then the tables that you specify are added
to the set.

In this command, the backup set name is case-sensitive.

NOTE: The metadata of backup sets are stored within HBase. If you do not have access to the original HBase cluster with the
backup set metadata, then you must specify individual table names to restore the data.

To create a backup set, run the following command as the HBase superuser:

[source]
----
$ hbase backup set {add, remove, list, describe, delete} <backup_set_name> tables
----

[[br.using.subcommands]]
### Subcommands

The following list details subcommands of the hbase backup set command.

NOTE: You must enter one (and no more than one) of the following subcommands after hbase backup set to complete an operation.
Also, the backup set name is case-sensitive in the command-line utility.

_add_::
  Add tables to a backup set. Specify a _backup_set_name_ value after this argument to create a backup set.

_remove_::
  Removes tables from the set. Specify the tables to remove in the tables argument.

_list_::
  Lists all backup sets.

_describe_::
  Use this subcommand to display on the screen a description of a backup set. The information includes whether the set has full
  or incremental backups, start and end times of the backups, and a list of the tables in the set. This subcommand must precede
  a valid value for the _backup_set_name_ value.

_delete_::
  Deletes a backup set. Enter the value for the _backup_set_name_ option directly after the `hbase backup set delete` command.

[[br.using.optional.cli.arguments]]
### Optional Command-Line Arguments

_backup_set_name_::
  Use to assign or invoke a backup set name. The backup set name must contain only printable characters and cannot have any spaces.

_tables_::
  List of tables (or a single table) to include in the backup set. Enter the table names as a comma-separated list. If no tables
  are specified, all tables are included in the set.

TIP: Maintain a log or other record of the case-sensitive backup set names and the corresponding tables in each set on a separate
or remote cluster, backup strategy. This information can help you in case of failure on the primary cluster.

[[br.using.usage]]
### Example of Usage

[source]
----
$ hbase backup set add Q1Data TEAM3,TEAM_4
----

Depending on the environment, this command results in _one_ of the following actions:

* If the `Q1Data` backup set does not exist, a backup set containing tables `TEAM_3` and `TEAM_4` is created.
* If the `Q1Data` backup set exists already, the tables `TEAM_3` and `TEAM_4` are added to the `Q1Data` backup set.

[[br.restoring.backup]]
## Restoring a Backup Image

Run the following command as HBase superuser. You can only restore on a live HBase cluster because the data must be
redistributed to complete the restore operation successfully.

[source]
----
hbase restore {[-set backup_set_name] | [backup_root_path] | [backupId] | [tables]} [[table_mapping] | [-overwrite] | [-check]]
----

[[br.restore.required.args]]
### Required Command-Line Arguments

-set <backup_set_name>::
  The `-set` option here directs the utility to restore the backup set that you specify in the _backup_set_name_ argument.

_backup_root_path_::
  The _backup_root_path_ argument specifies the parent location of the stored backup image.

_backupId_::
  The backup ID that uniquely identifies the backup image to be restored.

_tables_::
  Table(s) to restore. The values for this argument must be entered directly after the `backupId` argument. Specify tables
  in a comma-separated list.

[[br.restore.optional.args]]
### Optional Command-Line Arguments

_table_mapping_::
  Directs the utility to restore data in the tables that are specified in the tables option. Each table must be mapped prior to
  running the command. Enter tables as a comma-separated list.

-overwrite::
  Truncates one or more tables in the target restore location and loads data from the backup image. The existing table must be
  online before the hbase restore command is run to successfully overwrite the data in the table. Compaction is not required for
  the data restore operation when you use the -overwrite argument.

-check::
  Verifies that the restore sequence and dependencies are in working order without actually executing a data restore.

[[br.restore.usage]]
### Example of Usage

[source]
----
hbase restore /tmp/backup_incremental backupId_1467823988425 mytable1,mytable2 -overwrite
----

This command restores two tables of an incremental backup image. In this example:
• `/tmp/backup_incremental` is the path to the directory containing the backup image.
• `backupId_1467823988425` is the backup ID.
• `mytable1` and `mytable2` are the names of tables in the backup image to be restored.
• `-overwrite` is an argument that indicates the restored tables overwrite all existing data in the versions of `mytable1` and
  `mytable2` that exist in the target destination of the restore operation.

[[br.administration]]
## Administrationg of Backup Images

The `hbase backup` command has several subcommands that help with administering backup images as they accumulate. Most production
environments require recurring backups, so it is necessary to have utilities to help manage the data of the backup repository.
Some subcommands enable you to find information that can help identify backups that are relevant in a search for particular data.
You can also delete backup images.

The following list details each `hbase backup subcommand` that can help administer backups. Run the full command-subcommand line as
the HBase superuser.

`hbase backup history [-n number_of_backups]`::
  Displays a log of backup sessions. The information for each session includes backup ID, type (full or incremental), the tables
  in the backup, status, and start and end time. Specify the number of backup sessions to display with the optional -n argument.
  If no number is specified, the command displays a log of 10 backup sessions.

`hbase backup describe {backupId}`::
  Lists the backup image content, time when the backup was taken, whether the backup is full or incremental, all tables in the
  backup, and backup status. The `backupId` option is required.

`hbase backup delete {backupId}`::
  Deletes the specified backup image from the system. The `backupId` option is required.

[[br.technical.details]]
## Technical Details of Incremental Backup and Restore

HBase incremental backups enable more efficient capture of HBase table images than previous attempts at serial backup-and-restore
solutions, such as those that only used HBase Export and Import APIs. Incremental backups use Write Ahead Logs (WALs) to capture
the data changes since the previous backup was created. A roll log is executed across all RegionServers to track the WALs that need
to be in the backup.

After the incremental backup image is created, the source backup files usually are on same node as the data source. A process similar
to the DistCp (distributed copy) tool is used to move the source backup files to the target file systems. When a table restore operation
starts, a two-step process is initiated. First, the full backup is restored from the full backup image. Second, all WAL files from
incremental backups between the last full backup and the incremental backup being restored are converted to HFiles, which the HBase
Bulk Load utility automatically imports as restored data in the table.

You can only restore on a live HBase cluster because the data must be redistributed to complete the restore operation successfully.

[[br.s3.backup.scenario]]
## Scenario: Safeguarding Application Datasets on Amazon S3

This scenario describes how a hypothetical retail business uses backups to safeguard application data and then restore the dataset
after failure.

The HBase administration team uses backup sets to store data from a group of tables that have interrelated information for an
application called green. In this example, one table contains transaction records and the other contains customer details. The
two tables need to be backed up and be recoverable as a group.

The admin team also wants to ensure daily backups occur automatically.

.Tables Composing The Backup Set
image::backup-app-components.png[]

The following is an outline of the steps and examples of commands that are used to backup the data for the _green_ application and
to recover the data later. All commands are run when logged in as HBase superuser.

1. A backup set called _green_set_ is created as an alias for both the transactions table and the customer table. The backup set can
be used for all operations to avoid typing each table name. The backup set name is case-sensitive and should be formed with only
printable characters and without spaces.

[source]
----
$ hbase backup set add green_set transactions
$ hbase backup set add green_set customer
----

2. The first backup of green_set data must be a full backup. The following command example shows how credentials are passed to Amazon
S3 and specifies the file system with the s3a: prefix.

[source]
----
$ ACCESS_KEY=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRST
$ SECRET_KEY=123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCD
$ sudo -u hbase hbase backup create full\
  s3a://$ACCESS_KEY:SECRET_KEY@prodhbasebackups/backups -set green_set
----

3. Incremental backups should be run according to a schedule that ensures essential data recovery in the event of a catastrophe. At
this retail company, the HBase admin team decides that automated daily backups secures the data sufficiently. The team decides that
they can implement this by modifying an existing Cron job that is defined in `/etc/crontab`. Consequently, IT modifies the Cron job
by adding the following line:

[source]
----
@daily hbase hbase backup create incremental s3a://$ACCESS_KEY:$SECRET_KEY@prodhbasebackups/backups -set green_set
----

4. A catastrophic IT incident disables the production cluster that the green application uses. An HBase system administrator of the
backup cluster must restore the _green_set_ dataset to the point in time closest to the recovery objective.

NOTE: If the administrator of the backup HBase cluster has the backup ID with relevant details in accessible records, the following
search with the `hdfs dfs -ls` command and manually scanning the backup ID list can be bypassed. Consider continuously maintaining
and protecting a detailed log of backup IDs outside the production cluster in your environment.

The HBase administrator runs the following command on the directory where backups are stored to print the list of successful backup
IDs on the console:

`hdfs dfs -ls -t /prodhbasebackups/backups`

5. The admin scans the list to see which backup was created at a date and time closest to the recovery objective. To do this, the
admin converts the calendar timestamp of the recovery point in time to Unix time because backup IDs are uniquely identified with
Unix time. The backup IDs are listed in reverse chronological order, meaning the most recent successful backup appears first.

The admin notices that the following line in the command output corresponds with the _green_set_ backup that needs to be restored:

`/prodhbasebackups/backups/backup_1467823988425`

6. The admin restores green_set invoking the backup ID and the -overwrite option. The -overwrite option truncates all existing data
in the destination and populates the tables with data from the backup dataset. Without this flag, the backup data is appended to the
existing data in the destination. In this case, the admin decides to overwrite the data because it is corrupted.

[source]
----
$ sudo -u hbase hbase restore -set green_set \
  s3a://$ACCESS_KEY:$SECRET_KEY@prodhbasebackups/backups backup_1467823988425 \ -overwrite
----

[[br.limitations]]
## Limitations of the Backup and Restore Utility

•	Only one active backup session is supported. link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-16391[HBASE-16391] will introduce multiple-backup sessions support.
•	Both backup and restore can’t be canceled while in progress. (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15997[HBASE-15997], link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15998[HBASE-15998]).
•	No supported for bulk-loaded data (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14417[HBASE-14417]).
•	Single backup destination only supported. link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-15476[HBASE-15476] will introduce multiple- backup destinations support.
•	There is no merge for incremental images (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14135[HBASE-14135]). This can increase restore time.  Users will need to periodically execute full backups to be able to restore data faster.
•	Only superuser (hbase) is allowed to perform backup/restore, which can be a problem for security (link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14138[HBASE-14138]).
•	During incremental backup ALL WAL data will be copied over to backup destination, including data from tables that are not being backed up. This functionality is a performance and security limitation. link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HBASE-14141[HBASE-14141] will introduce more granular copy WAL implementation.
